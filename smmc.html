<h1>Problem Solving Interest Group</h1>
  
 <!-- <h3><span style="color: red;">Next meeting: Sunday 23 August 14:30 - 16:30 on Zoom </span></h3> -->
 <!-- <h3><span style="color: red;">Competition: Saturday 12 October 10:00 - 17:30</span></h3> -->
  
<!-- Registration due Monday 16 September<br><br>-->

We meet regularly to discuss Olympiad-style math problems (<a href=https://www.simonmarais.org/uploads/8/2/3/5/82358688/smmc-2018-paper-a.pdf>examples</a>). It's a very relaxed group: there is no homework, you don’t need to come to every meeting, and you can come without joining the competition.<br><br>
Most problems require only very basic knowledge from high school (a few require year 2 math classes; I will tell you), but they’re challenging because they look unfamiliar and require creative solutions. The questions are hard and you are not expected to solve them all (in 2019 4 out of 8 questions is enough to come top 1/4 internationally and win $100AUD) - the aim is to have fun thinking about them. <br><br>
All students are welcome - all year groups, all majors, no matter which math classes you have or have not taken. <!--At the first 2019 meeting, we had 12 participants, mostly mainland math year 2.--><br><br>
After each meeting, I will send a summary of problem-solving tips we discussed. To join the mailing list, email me :<script language="javascript">--> <!--

About the competition (<a href=https://www.simonmarais.org/>Simon Marais Mathematics Competition</a>)
<ul>
<li> It takes place Saturday 9 October 2021 on campus, <!--10:00-13:00 and 14:30-17:30.</li>
<!-- <li> It takes place one Saturday in October, on campus,--> for three hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon.</li>
<li> You can enter by yourself, or with a friend (also from HKBU). The questions are the same, but the scoring is separate for individuals and for teams.</li>
<li> You compete for yourself, there is no "HKBU team" and no selection, everyone who wants to compete can do so. The only rule: you must be within your first 4 years of higher education (i.e. university or associate degree), and have previously competed less than 4 times.</li>
<li> Prizes: in 2019, everyone placing in the top 1/4 internationally received a certificate, and the best individual and pair from HKBU won $100AUD.</li>  
<li> HKBU result in 2019: 1 pair (year 3, one math, one comp) and 1 individual (year 3 math) placed in the top 1/4 internationally, by solving 4 questions out of 8.</li>
<li> HKBU result in 2018: 2 pairs (year 3 math, year 2 math) placed in the top 1/3 internationally, by solving 3 questions out of 8.</li>
</ul>
