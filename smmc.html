<TITLE>Problem Solving Interest Group</TITLE>

<BODY>

<h1>Problem Solving Interest Group</h1>

We meet regularly to discuss Olympiad-syle math problems (<a href=https://www.simonmarais.org/uploads/8/2/3/5/82358688/smmc-2018-paper-a.pdf>examples</a>). It's a very relaxed group: there is no homework, you don’t need to come to every meeting, and you can come without joining the competition.<br><br>
Most problems require only very basic knowledge from high school (a few require year 2 math classes; I will tell you), but they’re challenging because they look unfamiliar and require creative solutions. The questions are hard and you are not expected to solve them all (in 2018 3 out of 8 questions is enough to come top 1/3 internationally, and 4 out of 8 is top 15%) - the aim is to have fun thinking about them. <br><br>
All students are welcome - all year groups, all majors, and whether or not you have Olympiad experience.<br><br>
After each meeting, I will send a summary of problem-solving tips we discussed. To join the mailing list, email me :<script language="javascript">--> <!--

Possible meeting dates and activities: (for the current semester, the regular time is Friday 16:30 - 18:30)
<ul>
<li>March 8? - we may learn some number theory</li>
<li>March 29 or April 5</li>
<li>Near the end of exams, or maybe the summer? Depends if people are here. I will ask for an approximate decision whether you want to enter the competition, so I can book rooms and do other organisation.</li>
<li>Second week of Semester 1, 2019 - registration for the competition is due.</li>
<li>Week 5 or 6 of Semester 1, 2019 - finalising the details for the competition.</li>
</ul>


About the competition (<a href=https://www.simonmarais.org/>Simon Marais Mathematics Competition</a>)
<ul>
<li> It takes place on a Saturday in October on campus, for 3 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the afternoon.</li>
<li> You can enter by yourself, or with a friend. The questions are the same, but the scoring is separate for individuals and for teams.</li>
<li> You compete for yourself, there is no "HKBU team" and no selection, everyone who wants to compete can do so. The only rule: you must be within your first 4 years of higher education (i.e. university or associate degree), and have previously competed less than 4 times.</li>
<li> HKBU result in 2018: 2 teams (one from year 2, one from year 3) placed in the top 1/3 internationally, by solving 3 questions out of 8.</li>
</ul>
