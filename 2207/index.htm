   20 September: A couple of corrections to the Homework 1 solutions: in q1, the variables should be x,y,z instead of x1, x2, x3; in q3, the coefficient of t^3 should be -2.<br><br>
   
  20 September: Slides for the lecture on Friday 23 September are uploaded yesterday (right hand side of the calendar inside the schedule tab), and there is a version with 4 slides per page!<br><br>
  
   8 September: If you are thinking of doing more pure math, you should read "Linear Algebra" by W.C. Shiu and C.I. Chu: the first half is what's in our class, and the second half is the textbook for Math 3407 Advanced Linear Algebra. There are two copies in the library; if you want to buy one, contact <a href=http://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/~wcshiu/>Prof. Shiu</a>.<br><br>
   
   
   
  <!--
  11 September: <a href=http://amypang.github.io/2207/week2_print.pdf>Slides</a> for the lectures on 12 and 19 September were uploaded yesterday.<br><br>
   
  8 September: Non math majors: this year, we will be offering this class also in the second semester (with the same instructor). Please consider taking it then, as there will be fewer students.<br><br>
   
   5 September: There are minor updates to week 1 slides (pages 5, 6, 7, 24, 25).<br><br>
   
   5 September: Office hours and TA contacts are updated above and in the "general information" link above. The office hours aren't exactly what was chosen, for the following reason: the classroom is far from Dr. Pang's office, and she cannot reach the office by 15:30. Nonetheless, she is happy to take questions between the end of class and 16:30, either in her office or near the classroom.<br><br>
   
  2 September: If you are new to the math department, please come to the orientation session Saturday 10 September 10:00-14:00 @OEE601-3. More details and registration is available <a href=http://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/cafe/index.html>here</a>.<br><br>
   
   2 September: We will be choosing office hours in the first class. The times you can choose from are
   <ul>
   <li>Monday 15:30 - 17:30</li>
   <li>Wednesday 14:30 - 16:30</li>
   <li>Friday 9:30 - 11:30</li>
   <li>Friday 15:30 - 17:30</li>
   </ul>There will be 6 hours of office hours weekly, i.e. the least popular time listed above will not exist. The office hours will be with Dr. Pang in her office, FSC 1108.<br><br>
   
 10 July: This webpage is under construction. Everything currently here is subject to change before the start of the semester.

 <li>This schedule is tentative and subject to change throughout the semester. (We will try to go a little faster than what's written.)</li>
 <li>The stars indicate the rough difficulty of the topic. The numbers indicate the relevant sections of the textbook (5th edition).</li>
 <li>The lecture slides are outlines only, they do not contain everything covered in lectures, and reading them is not a substitute for coming to class.</li>
 <li>You are strongly recommended to quickly read the lecture slides and textbook sections before class, and to print and bring the lecture slides to class, so you can make notes on them, and easily refer to previous slides during class.  </li>
 <!--<li> The page numbers refer to the global edition of the textbook, 5th edition, but the corresponding sections of other editions should be equivalent. You will not be examined on the sections marked "skip". </li>--><br>

Some email etiquette:
<ul>
  <li>Please put "Math 2207" in the subject, and what you are asking about e.g. "Math 2207: ???". If you are emailing after the semester has ended, please also put "Fall 2016" in the subject.</li>
  <li>If emailing the instructor, please allow 24 hours for a response. Do NOT send a follow-up email or ask in person before 24 hours. A response from TAs may require more than 24 hours.</li>
  <li>If you are emailing about administrative issues, please use your @hkbu address.</li>
  <li>To include equations etc. in your emails, please attach a .pdf or .jpeg. (Take a screenshot or photo or scan, or use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.foxitsoftware.com/products/pdf-reader/">a PDF printer</a>.) No MS word documents or raw latex files please.</li>

    Quizzes: 15 minutes, in class. Dates will not be announced in advance.<br>
    Midterm: 1 hour, at the start of class: 13:30, Friday October 28 @ AAB205.<br>
    Final: 2 hours, sometime between 8-20 December. Exact date and location to be announced.<br>
    
<ul>
  <li>Each quiz can cover material from lectures up to 6 days before the quiz.</li>
  <li>The quizzes, midterm and the final are closed book exams. <!--No calculators will be allowed, but you don’t need to simplify any arithmetic unless explicitly told to do so in the question.--></li>
  <li>The questions on the quizzes, midterm and final will require you to show all your work, and there will be partial credit available.</li>
  <li>All homework questions are fair game for the quizzes, midterm and final. However, there will also be questions unlike those on the homework, which will require you to think on your feet. All questions will be solvable using material from class and from homework. <!--You will never be asked to solve the questions using a particular method. You may use any mathematically-valid method in your solution (including material from outside the class, as long as you explain it fully).--></li>
</ul>

<!-- On ?day (date), instead of in-class exercises, we will have a 15 minute quiz at the end of class. This is to encourage you to start preparing for the midterm, and so you can know how well you understand the material. The quiz does not count towards your grade, it is only to help you study. -->

<!--  <div id="faq">
Q: Is it ok to use another textbook?
A: There are two things to be careful of: 1. another textbook might not cover every topic in our syllabus; 2. they may use different terminology and notation. Point 2 especially might make things more confusing for you. If you can cope with the different notation, it is never bad to get a second point of view.
