 <li>This schedule is tentative and subject to change throughout the semester.</li>
 <li>The stars indicate the rough difficulty of the topic. The numbers indicate the relevant sections of the textbook (5th edition).</li>
 <li>You are strongly recommended to quickly read the lecture slides and textbook sections before class, and to print and bring the lecture slides to class, so you can make notes on them, and easily refer to previous slides during class.  </li>
 <li>If you are printing 4 slides per page, you should use the 2-slides-per-page version, it will look better. </li>
 <li>The lecture slides are outlines only, they do not contain everything covered in lectures, and reading them is not a substitute for coming to class.</li>
 <!-- <li> The section and page numbers refer to the global edition of the textbook, 5th edition, but the corresponding sections of other editions should be equivalent. --><!--You will not be examined on the sections marked "skip". --></li><br>

  <li>Please staple all sheets of your homework together, and put your name and student ID clearly on the front page.</li>
  <li>You are strongly encouraged to make a copy of your homework (e.g. take a picture with your phone) before handing it in, so you can compare your work to the official solutions as soon as possible after the deadline.</li>

    Quizzes: 15-20 minutes, in class. Dates will not be announced in advance.<br>
    Midterm: 1 hour, at the start of class: 15:30 Monday 12 March @AAB706 (to be confirmed).<br>
    Final: 2 hours, sometime between 4 - 16 May.<br><br>
    
     <!--<a href=examinfo.pdf>Some information about question style</a>.<br><br>
     Quiz 1 is at the start of class Tuesday 14 February, and covers everything on the notes of Weeks 1-3, roughly Sections 1.1-1.5 and 1.7, on linear systems, span and linear independence.<br><br>
    The midterm will cover everything up to and including the class of Friday 24 February. This will include Sections 1.1-1.5, 1.7-1.9, 2.1-2.3, 3.1-3.3, 4.1.<br><br>
   -->
   <ul>
  <li>Each quiz can cover material from lectures up to 6 days before the quiz.</li>
  <li>No notes, phones or calculators are allowed in any of the exams. No theorems will be given to you.</li>
  <li>The questions on the quizzes, midterm and final will require you to show all your work, and there will be partial credit available.</li>
  <li>All homework questions are fair game for the quizzes, midterm and final. However, there will also be questions unlike those on the homework, which will require you to think on your feet. All questions will be solvable using material from class and from homework. <!--You will never be asked to solve the questions using a particular method. You may use any mathematically-valid method in your solution (including material from outside the class, as long as you explain it fully).--></li>
<!--
<li>In the final exam you will write in an answer book and not on the question paper.</li>
  <li>You will not be asked to repeat any proof from class in the exams, but the ideas of the proofs may help you to solve problems.</li>

<!--  <div id="faq">
Q: Is it ok to use another textbook?
A: There are two things to be careful of: 1. another textbook might not cover every topic in our syllabus; 2. they may use different terminology and notation. Point 2 especially might make things more confusing for you. If you can cope with the different notation, it is never bad to get a second point of view.

<h3>General study advice</h3> 
<a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cvincen1/files/teaching/StudySkills.pdf">Essential study tips from Dr Vincent, University of Wisconsin</a>. It's a long document, but full of really good advice. Sections 1, 2 and 5 are particularly relevant. Note that much of the logistical details in the last section are specific to the University of Wisconsin and do NOT apply to this class (e.g. we do NOT give incompletes).<br><br>
