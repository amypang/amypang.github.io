     9 February: In the solutions to Homework 1, the answers to 6c and 6d are swapped. So 6c is false and 6d is true. Also in the solution to 2b, x3 is not a free variable, only x2 is a free variable.

<ul>
 <li>This schedule is tentative and subject to change throughout the semester. (We will try to go a little faster than what's written.)</li>
 <li>The stars indicate the rough difficulty of the topic. The numbers indicate the relevant sections of the textbook (5th edition).</li>
 <li>The lecture slides are outlines only, they do not contain everything covered in lectures, and reading them is not a substitute for coming to class.</li>
 <li>You are strongly recommended to quickly read the lecture slides and textbook sections before class, and to print and bring the lecture slides to class, so you can make notes on them, and easily refer to previous slides during class.  </li>
 <!-- <li> The section and page numbers refer to the global edition of the textbook, 5th edition, but the corresponding sections of other editions should be equivalent. --><!--You will not be examined on the sections marked "skip". --></li><br>

<div id="hwk">
  <ul>
  <li>The dates in gray below are tentative and subject to change. It is the student's responsibility to check this page for new homework postings.</li>
  <li>Homework is due in class, 15 minutes after the start of class, on the due date. Please place your work on the piles near the entrances of the classroom. <b>No homework will be accepted after the due time, and no extensions will be granted under any circumstances.</b></li>
  <!-- <li>Each homework will generally cover material from lectures up to 6 days before the due date.</li> -->
  <li>You are encouraged to work with your classmates, but you must write up your solution by yourself - this is to ensure that you understand the solution, and can solve similar problems on the exams.</li>
  <li>There are no marks for optional problems, and the material is not in the syllabus. They are for students who want to learn something extra.</li>
  <li>Please staple all sheets of your homework together, and put your name and student ID clearly on the front page.</li>
  <li>You are strongly encouraged to make a copy of your homework (e.g. take a picture with your phone) before handing it in, so you can compare your work to the official solutions as soon as possible after the deadline.</li>
  <li>You can collect your graded homeworks and in-class exercises anytime from the box outside Dr. Pang's office. </li>

    Quizzes: 15-20 minutes, in class. Dates will not be announced in advance.<br>
    Midterm: 1 hour, at the start of class: 13:30 Friday 3 March @ WLB103 OR 12:30 Tuesday 7 March @ WLB104.<br>

<ul>
  <li>Each quiz can cover material from lectures up to 6 days before the quiz.</li>
  <li>No notes, phones or calculators are allowed in any of the exams. No theorems will be given to you.</li>
  <li>The questions on the quizzes, midterm and final will require you to show all your work, and there will be partial credit available.</li>
  <li>All homework questions are fair game for the quizzes, midterm and final. However, there will also be questions unlike those on the homework, which will require you to think on your feet. All questions will be solvable using material from class and from homework. <!--You will never be asked to solve the questions using a particular method. You may use any mathematically-valid method in your solution (including material from outside the class, as long as you explain it fully).--></li>
<!--
<li>In the final exam you will write in an answer book and not on the question paper.</li>
  <li>You will not be asked to repeat any proof from class in the exams, but the ideas of the proofs may help you to solve problems.</li>

<!--  <div id="faq">
Q: Is it ok to use another textbook?
A: There are two things to be careful of: 1. another textbook might not cover every topic in our syllabus; 2. they may use different terminology and notation. Point 2 especially might make things more confusing for you. If you can cope with the different notation, it is never bad to get a second point of view.

<h3>General study advice</h3> 
<a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cvincen1/files/teaching/StudySkills.pdf">Essential study tips from Dr Vincent, University of Wisconsin</a>. It's a long document, but full of really good advice. Sections 1, 2 and 5 are particularly relevant. Note that much of the logistical details in the last section are specific to the University of Wisconsin and do NOT apply to this class (e.g. we do NOT give incompletes).<br><br>
