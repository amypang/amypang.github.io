<a href=Math2205Spring2017info.pdf>General information</a> (updated 9 January)<br>
Prerequisites: <a href=prereq.pdf>Questions</a> to review your single-variable differential calculus and linear algebra (check your answer with <a href=http://www.wolframalpha.com>WolframAlpha</a>); <a href=http://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/~felix_kwok/2016/>last year's single-variable calculus notes</a> (we need chapters P-4).<br><br>
 Geogebra graphing app: <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/3d">3D</a>, <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/graphing">2D</a>. Syntax: to write <img src=eqnforgeogebrasyntaxdemo.PNG>, type "z^2 &#8594 = x / 4 &#8594 +y" (basically, ^ makes powers, / makes fractions, and arrow keys let you move out of powers and denominators).<br><br>

   <!--28 March: Midterm 2 is on Monday 3 April. It is roughly one hour, and will cover differentiation (Sections 12.2-12.7, 12.9) and classifying critical points (part of Section 13.1). This is everything in the slides labelled Weeks 7-10, and all the exercise sheet questions from sheet #13 until sheet #18. <a href=examinfo.pdf>Here</a> is some information on midterm 2 and the final.<br><br>-->
  27 March: I made major edits to week 10 slides p5, 6, 12 (as shown in red), please download them again. <br><br>
  21 March: To audition in the math department short film, <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScwLSPSDfXA5lC1_UHIDETVOEsSPOhzWitvm82ulxBev58RRA/viewform?c=0&w=1&usp=send_form>sign up here</a>. Don't forget to <a href=http://www.facebook.com/baptistu.mathematics>add the math department on Facebook</a>.<br><br>
  
   21 March: Your exercise sheets from yesterday and today have been graded and you can collect them from the box outside Dr. Pang's office at any time.<br><br>
   
   14 March: I made major edits to week 8 slides p2, 5, 9 (as shown in red), please download them again. Many many thanks to the students who pointed out confusing points and arithmetic errors in class, today and throughout the semester!<br><br>
13 March: The <a href=midterm1notes.pdf>notes</a> from the start of class today, about some common errors on midterm 1.<br><br>
  
   21 February: Two ways to find the limits for triple integrals: the <a href=http://mathinsight.org/triple_integral_shadow_method>shadow method</a> (what I always use in class, and Example 4 in Section 14.5 of the textbook) and the <a href=http://mathinsight.org/triple_integral_cross_section_method>cross-section method</a> (Example 3 in Section 14.5 of the textbook).<br><br>
   
   13 February: As announced in class today, Midterm 1 is Monday 6 March, Midterm 2 is Monday 3 April.<br><br>
   
   7 February: The <a href="http://abstrusegoose.com/230">comic</a> I showed in class today about the process of doing mathematics - every time you see a short and simple solution, there were a million wrong attempts behind it. So if you're confused about how to solve a problem, that's completely normal!<br><br>
   
   3 February: Added Riemann sum websites above.<br><br>
   
    24 January: <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6puD8AWFSlY>Two</a> <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZofoRuDJXhM>videos</a> on how to draw hyperbolic paraboloids. (You can rotate the x,y axes in your drawing if you want, but try to keep z vertical.)<br><br>
  
  
   20 January: Two movie recommendations, both true stories about mathematicians:
  <ul>
<li><a href=https://movie.yahoo-leisure.hk/movie/details/31036>The Man who Knew Infinity</a> - An Indian genius with no formal training wants to work with a top Cambridge professor. Screening organised by HKBU Math Alumni, Saturday 25 March, register <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdP6hwdkEp6RaJP_pRZ9_ZbhgtvrGJJQfDhYfg4lUU4aegUpg/viewform>here</a>.</li>
<li><a href=https://movie.yahoo-leisure.hk/movie/details/DvBOQ>Hidden Figures</a> - A female mathematician and two engineers defy racial and gender expectations to calculate flight paths for NASA's missions to the moon. Showing from 2 February (no organised screening - but why not plan one with your friends?).</li>
</ul>
  
   <!--
    16 March: Your exercise sheets from this week have been graded and you can collect them from the box outside Dr. Pang's office at any time.<br><br>
 
  9 March: Your exercise sheets from Tuesday and your Homework 3 have been graded and you can collect them from the box outside Dr. Pang's office at any time.<br><br>
  
     4 March: Calculators are allowed on the midterms (and also on the final), for arithmetic only.<br><br>
   4 March: Dr. Pang will be in school for a short time tomorrow (Sunday 5 March). If you would like to ask her a last-minute question, send her an email to arrange a time.<br><br>
    1 March: Your exercise sheets from yesterday and Monday have been graded and you can collect them from the box outside Dr. Pang's office at any time.<br><br>
     27 February: about midterm I, on Monday 6 March:
  <ul>
   <li> It will be roughly one hour (maybe slightly shorter or longer).</li>
 <li> The midterm will cover the geometry (Sections 10.2, 10.4, 10.5, 10.1, 12.1) and multiple integration (Sections 14.1, 14.2, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6), but NOT improper integrals (Sections 6.5, 14.3). This is everything in the slides labelled Weeks 1-5 (EXCEPT p42 of Week 5), and all the exercise sheet questions from the beginning until sheet #12 Q1. You will not be tested explicitly on single-variable integration (Sections 5.1-5.7, 6.1), but of course those techniques are useful for calculating multiple integrals.</li>
 <li> You will be given the same antiderivatives that are on homeworks 2 and 3.</li>
   </ul>
  23 February: Your graded homework 2, and all past exercise sheets, can be collected from the box outside Dr. Pang's office.<br><br>
    24 January: Your exercise sheets from yesterday and today have been graded and you can collect them from the box outside Dr. Pang's office at any time.<br><br>
    19 January:
<ul>

<li>Your in-class exercises from Monday have been graded and you can collect them from the box outside Dr. Pang's office at any time.</li>
</ul>
   
  16 January: The calendar in the schedule tab is fixed. You may need to clear your browser's cache to see it.<br><br>
      5 January: General info above is updated.<br><br>
     7 December: Prerequisites are posted above. <br><br>
     21 November: We may assign homework from the textbook (7th or 8th edition), so make sure you have access to a copy.<br><br>
     7 July: This webpage is under construction. Everything currently here is subject to change before the start of the semester.

 <li>The lecture slides are outlines only, they do not contain everything covered in lectures, and reading them is not a substitute for coming to class.</li>
 <li>You are strongly recommended to quickly read the lecture slides and textbook sections before class, and to print and bring the lecture slides to class, so you can make notes on them, and easily refer to previous slides during class.  </li>

     Midterm 1 will cover the geometry (Sections 10.2, 10.4, 10.5, 10.1, 12.1) and multiple integration (Sections 14.1, 14.2, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6), but NOT improper integrals (Sections 6.5, 14.3).

<ul>
  <li>The midterms and the final are closed book exams. You will be given a list of antiderivatives, see the start of Homework 2.<!--No calculators will be allowed, but you don’t need to simplify any arithmetic unless explicitly told to do so in the question.--></li>
  <li>Calculators are allowed, for arithmetic only.</li>
  <li>The questions on the midterms and final will require you to show all your work, and there will be partial credit available.</li>
  <li>All homework questions are fair game for the midterm and final. However, there will also be questions unlike those on the homework, which will require you to think on your feet. All questions will be solvable using material from class and from homework. <!--You will never be asked to solve the questions using a particular method. You may use any mathematically-valid method in your solution (including material from outside the class, as long as you explain it fully).--></li>
