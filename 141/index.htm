14 Oct: If you're unfamiliar with long division of numbers, <a href=https://www.mathsisfun.com/long_division2.html>here's an example</a>. You can probably google "long division" and find lots more explanations.<br><br>   
12 Oct: Added quiz 1 statistics (averages etc.) to the Exams page. Quiz 2 is tentatively schedule for 26, 27, 28 Oct.<br><br>
6 Oct: Added suggested questions for trignometric integration (7.2) to Resources page.<br><br>
1 Oct: Solutions to quiz 1 are posted, see the Exams page.<br><br>
1 Oct: Added IBP questions to the Resources page, plus the optional IBP handout from lecture. The physical handout had a typo: in part d, the substitution should be t=arcsin x.<br><br>
25 Sep: If you have logistic issues for the quizzes (e.g. you are writing at the OSD), please contact Dr. Pang directly, instead of through your TA. If you are writing at the OSD and did not receive a confirmation email this morning, you should email Dr. Pang asap.<br><br>
23 Sep: Added suggested questions on areas and volumes.<br><br>
18 Sep: SUMS is selling previous edition textbooks for really cheap in Burnside 911 until 5pm today!<br><br>
18 Sep: If you're puzzled by my comment at the end of class that the same substitution will work as long as n is odd and positive: try n=5. Remember, there is no substitute for learning from experience!<br><br>
17 Sep: Quiz 1 info is posted on the Exams page.<br><br>
14 Sep: If you're a bit overwhelemed with the material right now, it may help to know we have 7 weeks of computation coming up. Also, things should be a lot better after tutorials, where you see more examples of how to solve problems. If you're still lost, come to office hours and we can work through some questions together.<br><br>    
14 Sep: Added links to tutors and the helpdesk to the Resources page, in response to a student query. Some of these are free!<br><br>    
9 Sep: Today seemed to be a hard lecture. It may be reassuring to know that, in this class, we will rarely compute integrals with the definition I showed you today. Instead, in the next couple of lectures, we will see that integrals are equivalent to antiderivatives, and we will spend much time learning various techniques to hand-compute antiderivatives. However, the vast majority of functions in the sciences do not have antiderivatives that are computable by hand, so in almost all real-world applications of integration, you will be programming a computer to use the definition I showed you today. That's why it's important to understand the definition. <br>On Friday, we will do some intuitive examples, which should help. Reading Section 5.2 and thinking about questions 33 and 51 would also help.<br><br>
9 Sep: Added more info to the Exams page. <br><br>
8 Sep: Added resources page. Have a look at the Riemann sum visualiser link there.<br><br>
7 Sep: Added study tips link to resources - this is a really excellent document, please read!<br><br>
6 Sep: Added TAs and tutorial times.<br><br>
5 Sep: Added FAQ page with some questions from the first lecture; added more info to the Exams page. <br><br>
5 Sep: About the summation-of-i^2 fact that I used in the first lecture - I will give you this fact on all quizzes and the final. And you do NOT need to know its proof, but if you're interested, here's <a href=http://mathoverflow.net/a/8851>a picture proof that I like</a>. <br><br>

Solutions for <a href=quiz1soln2.pdf>tutorial 2</a>, <a href=quiz1soln3.pdf>tutorial 3</a>, <a href=quiz1soln4.pdf>tutorial 4</a>, <a href=quiz1soln5.pdf>tutorial 5</a>, <a href=quiz1soln6.pdf>tutorial 6</a>, and <a href=quiz1stats.pdf>statistics.</a><br>
Quiz 2: October 26, 27, 28, tentatively. <br>
Quiz 3: mid November <br>
Final exam: between 9 and 22 December, decided by the university. <br><br>
<b>You may only take the quizzes in the tutorial in which you are registered</b>. If you even attempt a quiz in another tutorial, you will automatically receive a score of zero. There will be no makeup quiz whatsoever.<br><br>

If you have logistic issues for the quizzes or the final (e.g. you are writing at the OSD), please contact Dr. Pang directly, instead of through your TA.<br><br>

The quizzes and the final are closed book exams. No calculators will be allowed, but you don’t need to simplify any arithmetic unless explicitly told to do so in the question. If the question asks for simplification, then trignometric values at multiples of pi/6 and pi/4 need to be evaluated.<br><br>

All WebWork questions are fair game for the quizzes and final. However, there will also be questions unlike those on WebWork, which will require you to think on your feet. All questions will be solvable using material from lectures, tutorials, and WebWork. You will never be asked to solve the questions using a particular method. You may use any mathematically-valid method of your choice, (including material from outside the class, as long as you explain it fully).<br><br>

The final is 3 hours long, and has two parts. In Part A, only your final answer will be scored; there is no partial credit. In Part B, you are expected to show all of your work and justify your answers; there will be partial credit available. There are no multiple choice questions.<br><br>

The quizzes last 30 - 40 minutes. Unless noted otherwise, the questions on the quizzes are of a similar standard to the final, and will be graded in the same way. They will require you to show all your work, and there will be partial credit available.<br><br>

The questions on the quizzes for each tutorial are entirely different, but they share the same format. About 10 days before each quiz, the common format will be released through MyCourses, and reposted here. You are encouraged to set up subscriptions to postings on MyCourses.<br><br>

Solutions to quiz questions will be posted here and on MyCourses shortly after all students have taken the quiz.<br><br>

The quizzes and final are written by Dr. Pang. (Dr. Pang did not write any questions for the calculus classes she taught previously at Stanford University, which use a different textbook, and the questions for this course are not based on those.)<br><br>

The quizzes are graded by the TAs, though not necessarily your own TA, and the final is graded by Dr. Pang and the TAs. It is your responsibility to contact your TA to retrieve your graded quizzes.<br><br>

</div>

  <div id="faq">
Q: Will there be lecture notes / lecture recordings? <br>
A: No. I know some people can't get to class on time because of the location, but if I put out lecture notes / lecture recordings, it will be too tempting to procrastinate, and calculus is not something you can cram at the last minute. I want you to do well in the class, so I'm going to motivate you to keep up with the material.<br><br>

Q: Is it ok to use the 6th or 7th edition of the textbook?<br>
A: I don't know exactly all the differences between the different editions, but if it is an Early Transcendentals version, you will probably be fine. The advantage of a newer edition is that it has more problems for you to practise on. Make sure you check with someone with the 8th edition whenever we mention a page, question, or section, since the numbering will definitely be different in older editions.<br><br>

Q: Is it ok to use another textbook?<br>
A: If you really want to, I can't stop you, but I really don't recommend it. Other textbooks might not contain all the material in our class. Calculus is a vast subject, and different authors focus on different aspects of it.<br><br>

Q: This class is required for my major, but I know integration already, do I really have to take it?<br>
A: You can take a <a href=https://www.mcgill.ca/students/exams/science>placement exam</a> and be exempt from the class. It seems like the application deadline has long passed, but speak to an academic advisor and see if something can be worked out.<br><br>

Q: Will calculators be allowed in quizzes or the final?<br>
A: No. But you don’t need to simplify any arithmetic unless explicitly told to do so in the question.<br><br>

Q: Will there be formula sheets in the quizzes or the final?<br>
A: You will get a few trig identities and summation formulae, but no antiderivatives will be provided, nor formulae for the various volume and area calculations. If you don't yet remember your antiderivatives, you haven't done enough practice problems to prepare for the exam.<br><br>

Q: How much trigonometry do we need to know for the quizzes and the final?<br>
A: You need to know the definition of the six trignometric functions, and the identities sin^2 x + cos^2 x =1, tan^2 x +1 = sec^2 x. You need to recognise sec^2 x as the derivative of tan x, tan x sec x as the derivative of sec x, 1/(1+x^2) as the derivative of arctan x, and 1/squareroot(1-x^2) as the derivative of arcsin x. You need to be able to evaluate all 6 trig functions at multiples of pi/6 and pi/4. Appendix D will help you with all this. The "double angle formulae" are very useful, but I will give them to you in the quizzes and the final. If we need the sum/product formulae, I will give them to you.<br><br>

Q: Should we do past finals to prepare for our final?<br>
A: The syllabus of the course and the style of questions change considerably from semester to semester, so past finals aren't necessarily representative of our final. However, they may be good preparation psychologically: it may be useful to do integration questions for three hours straight away from your notes.<br><br>

<h3>General</h3> 
<a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~cvincent/files/teaching/StudySkills.pdf">Essential study tips from Dr Vincent, University of Wisconsin</a>. Sections 1, 2 and 5 are particularly relevant. Note that much of the logistical details in the last section are specific to the University of Wisconsin and do NOT apply to this class (e.g. we do NOT give incompletes).<br><br>

The Math and Stat Department runs a Helpdesk weekdays from noon till 5pm in Burnside 911. It is staffed by undergraduate student tutors. There is also free <a href=http://peertutors.sus.mcgill.ca/>SUS peer tutoring</a>, and private tutoring from <a href=http://www.math.mcgill.ca/students/undergrad/tutors_list>grad students</a> and <a href=http://sums.math.mcgill.ca/doku.php/sums:tutoring>undergraduates (SUMS)</a>.<br><br>

<h3>Specific topics</h3>
(These questions may be different depending on whether you have the 7th or 8th edition of the textbook, but the same numbers are good practice in either edition.)<br><br>
