   18 April: There is a link to midterm solutions on the "Exams" section of this page.<br><br>
   14 February: <a href=rntpf2.pdf>A second proof of the Rank-Nullity Theorem</a> (typos fixed 3 March).<br><br>
   29 January: For your interest: <a href=http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~twk/Alg.pdf>notes</a> from my professor at Cambridge, that combine linear algebra and abstract algebra.<br><br>
   25 January: If you want to buy the textbook for $60, either come to office hours, or email me and I will bring your book to class.<br><br>
       
  <!-- 31 January: Your homework 1 has been graded and is available for collection anytime from the box outside Dr. Pang's office.<br><br>
   
19 February: In case you haven't seen: Homework 2 deadline has been extended to next Wednesday.<br><br>  
 15 February: Our midterm is in class Monday 4 March. It covers Chapters 6 and 7. More information is on the Exam tab.<br><br>
  23 January: You may buy the textbook for $60 from my office today (Wednesday) 14:30 - 16:30, or at office hours Thursday 13:30 - 15:30, or in class on Friday.<br><br>
    22 January: The textbooks will be available very soon. Please watch your emails and this webpage for how to buy them.<br><br>
 20 January: Please <a href=https://hkbuhk.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0f94rRROmKnJN0F>fill in this survey</a> about your interest in this class, and whether we can move the 8:30 class.<br><br> 
 15 January: To buy Prof Shiu's textbook, please email me <b>before January 21</b>.<br><br>
  19 December: If you did not choose this course in pre-registration but plan to take it, please let me know, so I can estimate how many people are interested, thanks.
14 December: I have 1 copy left of Prof Shiu's textbook ($60HKD), please contact me if you want to buy. >We only print them when students buy them, so after this one is sold, you will have to wait till the third week of class.<br><br>
 10 November: Please choose this course in preregistration if you intend to take! (And email me if you cannot choose it because of over-crediting etc.) It would really help me to know how many people are interested, thanks.<br><br>
 9 August: The information here is released only to help you make preregistration decisions. Everything currently here is subject to change before the start of the semester.

  <!-- <li>Each homework will generally cover material from lectures up to 6 days before the due date.</li> -->
  <li>You are encouraged to work with your classmates, but you must write up your solution by yourself - this is to ensure that you understand the solution, and can solve similar problems on the exams.</li>

  <li>Please staple all sheets of your homework together, and put your name and student ID clearly on the front page.</li>
  <li>You are strongly encouraged to make a copy of your homework (e.g. take a picture with your phone) before handing it in, so you can compare your work to the official solutions as soon as possible after the deadline.</li>
<li>Solutions will be available shortly after you receive your graded homework. Solutions require Moodle login, and some solutions will be blocked to individual students to encourage you to try the question again.</li>

 Midterm: roughly one hour, in class Monday 4 March. <a href=https://buelearning.hkbu.edu.hk/mod/resource/view.php?id=821571>Solutions</a> (requires Moodle login).<br>
    Final: 9:00 - 11:00, Tuesday 14 May.<br><br>
    
     <a href=examinfo.pdf>Some information about question style</a>.<br><br>
  The midterm will cover Chapters 6 and 7. This is probably everything up to and including the class of 22 February, and maybe a little more.<br><br>
   No notes are allowed in any of the exams. You will be given the reference sheet. Calculators are allowed.
   <!--
   <ul>
   <li>No notes are allowed in any of the exams. You will be given the reference sheet. Calculators are allowed.</li>
 
 <li>The questions on the  midterm and final will require you to show all your work, and there will be partial credit available.</li>
<li>In the final exam you will write in an answer book and not on the question paper.</li>
  <li>All homework questions are fair game for the quizzes, midterm and final. However, there will also be questions unlike those on the homework, which will require you to think on your feet. All questions will be solvable using material from class and from homework. You will never be asked to solve the questions using a particular method. You may use any mathematically-valid method in your solution (including material from outside the class, as long as you explain it fully).</li>
  <li>You will not be asked to repeat exactly any proof from class in the exams, but the ideas of the proofs may help you to solve problems.</li>

 </ul>

   <div id="chat">
Ask your questions anonymously, or collaborate with your classmates. You may write in English or Chinese. You can handwrite math by clicking on the "squareroot x button", or attach photos using the camera. <br>
    I sometimes post minor announcements here, like the theorems covered in each class, the night before.<br>

<h3>General study advice</h3> 
<a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cvincen1/files/teaching/StudySkills.pdf">Essential study tips from Dr Vincent, University of Wisconsin</a>. It's a long document, but full of really good advice. Sections 1, 2 and 5 are particularly relevant. Note that much of the logistical details in the last section are specific to the University of Wisconsin and do NOT apply to this class (e.g. we do NOT give incompletes).<br><br>
