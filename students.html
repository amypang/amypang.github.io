<TITLE>Amy Pang's recruitments</TITLE>

<BODY>

All information on this page is for guidance only, and may be changed at any time. (Last update: 2 September 2019.)<br>
 <!-- Until 2020, I'm very happy to support short term visitors e.g. grad students or postdocs to coming for 2-3 months, email me for details. -->

  <!--
<h1>Postdocs</h1>
  
  I am hiring one postdoc; grad students can also come for a few months on a similar arrangement. Dates and duration are flexible, with the first contract ending in August 2019 at the latest. It may be renewable for a second contract, depending on funding. It is a research-only position, there are no teaching or administrative duties.<br><br>
You can be in any area of mathematics or statistics. I'm quite keen to explore how your work can intersect with <a href=research.html>my research interests</a> (descent algebras, combinatorial Hopf algebras, algebraic Markov chains), but it might not always be possible to start joint projects, so you should also be prepared to work independently.<br><br>
Almost all <a href=http://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/Research/research_IMAGEgroups.html>HKBU math faculty</a> work in numerical methods or statistics. Pure mathematics (algebra, analysis, lots of geometry) is available at many other universities in the city, such as <a href=http://hkumath.hku.hk/web/research/group.html>HKU</a>, <a href=http://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/research/research-interests>CUHK</a>, <a href=http://www.math.ust.hk/about_us/research.php>HKUST</a>. I also know a cross-institutional probability community. Since you have no teaching duties, you can spend most of your time collaborating with those groups on their campuses should you prefer.<br><br>
Given the independent nature of this position, it is probably more suitable those needing some research time to strengthen a tenure-track application, than for fresh PhDs who may want more guidance in research direction.<br><br>
Hong Kong is an exciting and convenient place to live, and you can live well knowing only English.<br><br>
To apply, email me with a CV, a research statement, and the contacts of two recommenders.<br><br>

<h1>MPhil or PhD students</h1>
 
 <span style="color: red;">I am not recruiting until at least 2021.</span><br><br>
 
 HKBU is changing its graduate programme structure for 2019-2020, so the below may not be accurate. Email me for the latest situation.

<h3>Who will you consider?</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should have a degree in Mathematics (either bachelor or masters), and you should have taken advanced courses in algebra. Previous research experience is not necessary.</li>
<li>Before formally applying, you should send me some pieces of your mathematical writing e.g an undergraduate or masters' theses, or papers you wrote for classes. <!--If you have expository writing, please send this in addition to any original research you have done.--></li>
<li>If I'm interested in supervising you, I will arrange some skype meetings to talk mathematically, so I can see whether I enjoy working with you. (Meeting in person is of course preferable, but not always practical.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What research will I do?</h3>
You can bring your own research topic in algebraic or enumerative combinatorics, or work on some of my questions regarding algebraic structures on combinatorial objects, such as combinatorial Hopf algebras, Hopf monoids in species, or dual graded graphs. You should be aware that almost all <a href=http://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/Research/research_IMAGEgroups.html>HKBU math faculty</a> work in numerical methods or statistics. Pure mathematics (algebra, analysis, lots of geometry) is available at many other universities in the city, such as <a href=http://hkumath.hku.hk/web/research/group.html>HKU</a>, <a href=http://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/research/research-interests>CUHK</a>, <a href=http://www.math.ust.hk/about_us/research.php>HKUST</a>. I also know a cross-institutional probability community.<br><br>

<h3>What is the normal course of study?</h3>
<li>MPhil: the normal course of study is 2 years. Applications are accepted year-round, and you may start at any time. Allow 2 months for the processing of your application, and 3 months for the visa.</li>
<li>PhD: the normal course of study is 4 years. If you apply before December 1, you may start on September 1; if you apply before April 1, you may start on January 1. All recommendations and supporting documents (e.g. English language tests) must be submitted before the deadline, so please start your application early!</li>

<h3>What funding is available?</h3>
If I take you as a student, you will be fully supported. If you are not a Hong Kong citizen, you should apply for <a href=https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html>The Hong Kong Postgraduate Fellowship</a>, which will give you more support. Also there is a little support for conference travel.

<h3>What requirements about courses are there?</h3>
 <li>(MPhil and PhD) A general class on academic writing, presentation, teaching, academic integrity, etc.</li>
 <li>(PhD only) One compulsory class in either applied math (optimisation, PDEs, numerical linear algebra, combined in one class) or statistics.</li>
 <li>3 (MPhil) or 4 (PhD) further courses, either statistics/numerics at HKBU, or pure math at UST, or anything from <a href=https://gs.hkbu.edu.hk/current-students/research-postgraduate-programmes/academic-requirements/course-registration/cross-institutional-course-enrolment-scheme>this list</a>. 1 (MPhil) or 2 (PhD) courses can be an advanced undergraduate course in pure math<!-- (e.g. functional analysis, measure theory, differential geometry, point-set topology, elementary number theory, Markov chains, ...).  -->. </li>
 <li>(PhD only) Qualifying examinmation, in the third semester.</li>
 <li>(PhD only) Attendance at research seminars, at HKBU or other universities, and giving an informal presentation once a semester about your research work.</li>
  
 <h3>What other research requirements are there?</h3>
 <li>Confirmation of candidature: written only for MPhil, written and seminar for PhD.</li>
 <li>(PhD only) A presentation at an international conference (e.g. a poster submission to <a href=http://fpsac.org/>FPSAC</a>), and a paper submission to a journal.</li>
 <li>(PhD only) 3-6 months spent overseas but not in your home country. I will help to arrange this.</li>
  
<h3>What teaching duties are there?</h3>
You are expected to be a TA every semester, for three hours weekly. This may involve grading homeworks, answering questions in tutorials, etc. It is a very light load. 

<h3>What languages do I need to know?</h3>
You should be able to do mathematics in English. Your dissertation, courses, seminars and teaching assignments will be in English, and I also prefer to discuss mathematics in English. You can live well in Hong Kong knowing only English. Knowledge of Chinese will be useful community-wise, as almost all your mathematical classmates and teachers will be Chinese.

<h3>Are there requirements about being on campus?</h3>
Yes. You are expected to be in Hong Kong (or on research-related travels) except on public holidays and for 14 days of official leave each year.

<h1>Research Assistants</h1>

If you have expertise coding combinatorial Hopf algebras in Sage (e.g. you can write <a href=https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25916>this</a>), then I may hire you for a few months. You need to work independently and be physically on campus.


I am hiring one research assistant, for 3 months initially (flexible start date between now and mid-2020), to <a href=https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13793>code combinatorial Hopf algebras</a> in <a href=http://www.sagemath.org/>Sage</a>. You need to work independently and be physically on campus.

Requirements:
<ul>
<li>You should have contributed to Sage before, or written some mathematically similar code.</li>
<li>You should have a bachelor degree (in any subject), and have taken advanced classes in algebra. A masters' degree in an algebraic area would be an advantage</li>
<li>You should be able to do math in English.</li> 
</ul>

To apply, email me:
<ul>
<li>your CV;</li>
<li>your academic transcript;</li>
<li>a description of your mathematical coding experience, including some sample code. Previous Sage contributions are an advantage.</li>
</ul>
  And please arrange for someone (preferably someone I know) to send me a short reference of your mathematical and coding background.
