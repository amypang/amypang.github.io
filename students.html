<h1>Research Assistants</h1>

I am hiring one research assistant, for 6 months (flexible start date), to <a href=https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13793>code combinatorial Hopf algebras</a> in <a href=http://www.sagemath.org/>Sage</a>. More information will be available soon.



<h1>PhD students</h1>

<h3>Who will you consider?</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should have more than a bachelor degree, preferably a Masters' involving some research. At least one of your degrees should be in Mathematics, and you should have taken advanced courses in algebra.</li>
<li>You should send me some pieces of your mathematical writing - send me any research papers or projects, undergraduate or masters' theses, and any papers you wrote for classes. I would like to see expository work as well as any original research you have done.</li>
<li>If I'm interested in supervising you, I will arrange some skype meetings to talk mathematically, so I can see whether I enjoy working with you. (Meeting in person is of course preferable, but not always practical.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What research will I do?</h3>
You can bring your own research topic in algebraic or enumerative combinatorics, or work on some of my questions regarding algebraic structures on combinatorial objects, such as combinatorial Hopf algebras and dual graded graphs.

<h3>What is the normal course of study?</h3>
The normal course of study is 3 years. The usual start date is September, with some informal meetings in August, but it is possible to start in October or November, if that is more convenient for you.

<h3>What funding is available?</h3>
If I take you as a student, you will be fully supported. If you are not a Hong Kong citizen, you should apply for <a href=https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html>The Hong Kong Postgraduate Fellowship</a>, which will give you more support. Also there will probably be support for conference travel, and for a short overseas research attachment in your final year.

<h3>What requirements about courses are there?</h3>
You are required to achieve good grades in 4 graduate courses. These can either be pure maths courses at HKUST or other Hong Kong universities, or statistics / numerics topics courses here at HKBU.

<h3>What teaching duties are there?</h3>
You are expected to be a TA every semester, for three hours weekly. This may involve grading homeworks, example classes, etc. It is a very light load. 

<h3>What languages do I need to know?</h3>
You should be able to do mathematics in English. Your dissertation, courses, seminars and teaching assignments will be in English. You can live well in Hong Kong knowing only English. Knowledge of Chinese will be useful community-wise, as almost all your mathematical classmates and teachers will be Chinese.

<h3>Are there requirements about being on campus?</h3>
Yes. You are expected to be in Hong Kong except on public holidays and for 15 days of official leave each year.
