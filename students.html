All information on this page is for guidance only, and may be changed at any time. (Last update: 22 April 2018.)<br>
 Other positions may be available, email me for details.
  
  <h1>Postdocs</h1>
  
  I am hiring one postdoc. Dates are flexible, with the first contract ending in August 2019 at the latest. It may be renewable for a second contract, lasting up to one year. It is a research-only position, there are no teaching or administrative duties. (travel funds?) <br><br>
You can be in any area of mathematics or statistics. If you intersect with <a href=research.html>my research interests</a> (descent algebras, combinatorial Hopf algebras, algebraic Markov chains), then we may start joint projects. Otherwise, you will mostly work independently.<br><br>
Almost all <a href=http://www.math.hkbu.edu.hk/Research/research_IMAGEgroups.html>HKBU math faculty</a> work in numerical methods or statistics. Pure mathematics (algebra, analysis, lots of geometry) is available at many other universities in the city, such as <a href=http://hkumath.hku.hk/web/research/group.html>HKU</a>, <a href=http://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/research/research-interests>CUHK</a>, <a href=http://www.math.ust.hk/about_us/research.php>HKUST</a>. I also know a cross-institutional probability community. Since you have no teaching duties, you can spend most of your time collaborating with those groups on their campuses should you prefer.<br><br>
Given the independent nature of this position, it is probably more suitable those needing some research time to strengthen a tenure-track application, than for fresh PhDs who may want more guidance in research direction.<br><br>
Hong Kong is an exciting and convenient place to live, and you can live well knowing only English.<br><br>
To apply, email me with a CV, a research statement, and the contacts of two recommenders.<br><br>


<h1>Research Assistants</h1>

I am hiring one research assistant, for 3 months initially (flexible start date between now and mid-2019), to <a href=https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13793>code combinatorial Hopf algebras</a> in <a href=http://www.sagemath.org/>Sage</a>. You need to work independently and be physically on campus.

Requirements:
<ul>
<li>You should have contributed to Sage before, or written some mathematically similar code.</li>
<li>You should have a bachelor degree (in any subject), and have taken advanced classes in algebra. A masters' degree in an algebraic area would be an advantage</li>
<li>You should be able to do math in English.</li> 
</ul>

To apply, email me:
<ul>
<li>your CV;</li>
<li>your academic transcript;</li>
<li>a description of your mathematical coding experience, including some sample code. Previous Sage contributions are an advantage.</li>
</ul>
  And please arrange for someone (preferably someone I know) to send me a short reference of your mathematical and coding background.




<h1>PhD students</h1>

<h3>Who will you consider?</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should have more than a bachelor degree, preferably a master degree involving some research. At least one of your degrees should be in Mathematics, and you should have taken advanced courses in algebra.</li>
<li>Before formally applying, you should send me some pieces of your mathematical writing - send me any research papers or projects, undergraduate or masters' theses, and any papers you wrote for classes. I would like to see expository work as well as any original research you have done.</li>
<li>If I'm interested in supervising you, I will arrange some skype meetings to talk mathematically, so I can see whether I enjoy working with you. (Meeting in person is of course preferable, but not always practical.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What research will I do?</h3>
You can bring your own research topic in algebraic or enumerative combinatorics, or work on some of my questions regarding algebraic structures on combinatorial objects, such as combinatorial Hopf algebras and dual graded graphs.

<h3>What is the normal course of study?</h3>
The normal course of study is 3 years. It may be possible to extend to 4 years if you do not have a master degree. The usual start date is September, with some informal meetings in August, but it is possible to start in October or November, if that is more convenient for you.

<h3>What funding is available?</h3>
If I take you as a student, you will be fully supported. If you are not a Hong Kong citizen, you should apply for <a href=https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html>The Hong Kong Postgraduate Fellowship</a>, which will give you more support. Also there will probably be support for conference travel, and for a short overseas research attachment in your final year.

<h3>What requirements about courses are there?</h3>
You are required to achieve good grades in 4 graduate courses. These can either be pure maths courses at HKUST or other Hong Kong universities, or statistics / numerics topics courses here at HKBU.

<h3>What teaching duties are there?</h3>
You are expected to be a TA every semester, for three hours weekly. This may involve grading homeworks, example classes, etc. It is a very light load. 

<h3>What languages do I need to know?</h3>
You should be able to do mathematics in English. Your dissertation, courses, seminars and teaching assignments will be in English. You can live well in Hong Kong knowing only English. Knowledge of Chinese will be useful community-wise, as almost all your mathematical classmates and teachers will be Chinese.

<h3>Are there requirements about being on campus?</h3>
Yes. You are expected to be in Hong Kong (or on research-related travels) except on public holidays and for 15 days of official leave each year.
